    <h2>What is Web 3.0?</h2>
      <p>Web 3.0 (or Web3) is a term coined to describe a projection for the future of the World Wide Web based upon Blockchain technology and decentralization. In order to understand the concept of Web 3.0, it is helpful to first go back to the origin of the web itself, and its evolution into Web 2.0.</p>
    <h2>Web 1.0 Characteristics</h2>
      <p>The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 while he was employed at CERN.
      <br>
      <br>
          The first stage of the Web’s evolution has been retrospectively deemed ‘Web 1.0’ and refers to a period roughly from 1991 to 2004.
          This first iteration of the web was very basic compared to its current form, consisting almost entirely of static HTML pages, with minimal user interactivity, much like the website you are currently reading. They were mostly text based, with some images, hyperlinked content, GIFS, and minimal graphics. The creation of these pages required the knowledge of how to write and markup text using HTML, and as a result most web users were consumers/readers as opposed to producers of content.
      </p>
    <h2>Evolution into Web 2.0</h2>
      <p> Web 2.0 denoted a gradual and general shift during the mid 2000s onwards in the way the web was viewed and used, characterised by increased user participation and a change in web architecture to accommodate this participation. It also saw an increase in interactivity, a proliferation of complex features, and more dynamic content on web pages (‘rich user experience’) thanks to ongoing improvements in technologies, frameworks and languages. This resulted in a shift from mostly passive content engagement (reading a webpage) to interactive, collaborative and participatory content engagement and creation.
      <br>
      <br>
          A simple example of this is the rise of social networking websites (Facebook, Twitter, Myspace) and media sharing/content publishing platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Blogs). Coding/web design skill was no longer a prerequisite for sharing content online, as these websites provided an easy platform for users to publish their digital content with ease. In general, the user-base of the web expanded massively and became much more varied, in other words, creators went from typically being niche computer hobbyists to almost anyone and everyone.
      </p>
    <h2>Features of Web 2.0</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Folksonomy – free classification of information; allows users to collectively classify and find information (e.g. "tagging" of websites, images, videos or links)</li>
      <li>Rich user experience – dynamic content that is responsive to user input (e.g., a user can "click" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information)</li>
      <li>User participation – information flows two ways between the site owner and site users by means of evaluation, review, and online commenting. Site users also typically create user-generated content for others to see (e.g., Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)</li>
      <li>Software as a service (SaaS) – Web 2.0 sites developed APIs to allow automated usage, such as by a Web "app" (software application) or a mashup</li>
      <li>Mass participation – near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be hackersand computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Web 2.0 Issues and Criticisms</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, these new and exciting features of Web 2.0 brought along new problems as well. The newfound ease of publishing data online came at the cost of ownership of that data. While Web 1.0 was based mostly around the individual, this new era of the internet shifted the content and data ownership to corporations and websites. In essence, less and less people owned and maintained control of content they published online.
      <br>
      <br>
          Events such as Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal among other instances of mishandled data and privacy breaches brought this issue to light, and people started envisioning a web that placed the power back into the individual’s hands. Enter Web 3.0.
      </p>
    <h2>Web 3.0</h2>
        <p>The concept of Web 3.0 revolves around decentralisation and is proposed as a solution to the privacy and data issues that have plagued Web 2.0.  This would be achieved through implementation of Blockchain technology (most well-known at present for its use in Cryptocurrency), and decentralised protocols as opposed to the centralised protocols that are the backbone of the current web. Blockchain would allow ownership of digital content to be verifiable without the need for a centralised authority or company. Web 3.0 also seeks to incorporate cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance into more aspects of the internet.
        <br>
        <br>
           The hope is that the privacy and security offered by Blockchain will move power away from big tech companies and transfer it back to individuals, restore privacy and anonymity to the internet, and allow creators to better leverage content they produce.

      <h1 id="aside_header">Significance of Blockchain in Web 3.0</h1>
      <p>"Blockchain plays a crucial role in transforming the conventional approaches for data storage and management. In layman’s terms, blockchain offers a unique collection of data or a universal state layer, which is subject to collective management. The unique state layer provides the opportunity for developing a value settlement layer on the internet. The state layer helps in sending files in a copy-protected manner to enable effective P2P transactions without any intermediaries." - <a href="https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-in-web-3-0/" class="Reference">101 Blockchains</a></p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Blockchain</dt>
        <dd>A digital ledger comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. Each block is ‘chained’ to the next block using a cryptographic signature. Ethereum is a public blockchain, open to the world; its digital ledger is distributed, or synced, between many nodes; these nodes arrive at consensus regarding whether a transaction is valid before encrypting a number of transactions into a block.</dd>
        <dt>Cryptocurrency</dt>
        <dd>Digital currency that is based on mathematics and uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of units of currency as well as verifying the transfer of funds. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of a central bank, and are kept track of through distributed ledger technology.</dd>
        <dt>DAO</dt>
        <dd>A Digital Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO, pronounced like the Chinese concept) is a powerful and very flexible organizational structure built on a blockchain.</dd>
